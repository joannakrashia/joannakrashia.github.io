                            <p>Nicosia (Lefkosia) is the capital city of Cyprus, and some would say its very heart and soul. If you have limited time to see Cyprus, then Nicosia should be at the top of your list. Steeped in historic and archeoligical sites, the old city is surrounded by a complete circular wall built by the Venetians between 1567 and 1570, the periphery of which is about 3 miles. The wall has three gates (Paphos Gate, Famagusta Gate and Kyrenia Gate (in Turkish occupied area), as well as eleven heartshaped symmetric bastions. The Famagusta Gate with its two halls and passageway, has become Nicosia's Cultural Center and well worth visiting. The Paphos Gate is a controlled entrance point to the buffer zone, manned by the United Nations.</p>
                            <p>The narrow streets of the old city make it a unique and fascinating place to look around. Other places are well worth visiting are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>The Cyprus Handicraft Center</b> on Athalassa Avenue, where you can watch traditional art skills and handicraft being made, as well as buy traditional Cypriot products.</li>
                                <li><b>The Municipal Arts Center</b> on Apostolou Varnava Street, which was the Old Electricity Generating Plant, and is now a center for contemporary art.</li>
                                <li><b>The Leventis Municipal Museum</b> on Hyppocratous Street in Laiki Yitonia, next to Eleftheria Square, which houses exhibits dating from before 2000 BC up to the present day.</li>
                                <li><b>TThe Cyprus Museum</b> on Museum Street, said to be the richest and best archaeological museum in Cyprus, showing treasures of art from the Neolithic Period (5800 BC) to the early Byzantine Period (330-1192AD), including Cypriot pottery, terracotta, clay and stone sculptures, bronze and jewellery.</li>
                                <li><b>The Byzantine Art Museum</b> is housed within The Archbichopric (The Archbishop's palace), and displays the largest collection of Cyprus icons, with 220 pieces that cover the periods from the 5th to the 19th century.</li>
                                <li><b>Cyprus Jewellers Museum</b> on Praxippou Street, Laiki Yitonia, where traditional jewellery from the end of the 19th century are on display.</li>
                                <li><b>The Cyprus Postal Museum</b> on Agiou Savva street, where you will find a stamp collection that is internationally acknowledged for having some of the best and most significant stamps in the world, as well as a rare collection of pre-war designed post boxes, an automatic stamping machine, pre-war scales, and medals.</li>

                            </ul>

                            <p>Of course no visit to Nicosia would be complete without a shopping trip, and there is plenty on offer both in the Old City, as well as the new town along Arch Makarios Avenue.</p>
                                <p>The places listed above are just a very few of the many interesting things to see in Nicosia. Stop off at a Cyprus Tourist Information Center for much more information.</p></div>

                                        <p>Despite being the capital city and our hometown, it is probably not the ideal destination during summer time as it will be warmer than other cities and quite far from the beach. We would recommend that you come to Nicosia only for the wedding ceremony. If you are spending more days in Cyprus, you can plan a day trip (or an evening trip when the temperature is lower). If you decide to do so, we can provide more information.</p> </div>

                                <p>Limassol (Lemesos), until medieval times it was known as Nemesos, meaning 'in between' due to its position in between the two ancient cityies of Kourion and Amathus. This is a perfect place for anyone looking for a relaxing beach holiday combined with some historic sight seeing. Beaches in Limassol include - Ladies Mile Beach - Curium Beach - Pissouri Beach - Governor's Beach - Ayios Tychonas Beach, and many of them provide water sports such as wind surfing, paragliding, and scuba diving.

                                    <li><b>The Sanctuary of Apollon Ylatis</b> is located just 2.5km west of ancient kourion. Excavations at this important sanctuary have revealed structures such as the bath complex, the pilgrim halls, the palaistra and a holy precinct.</li>
                                    <li><b>Limassol Folk Art Museum</b> is situated on St. Andrews Street in Limassol's old town. Here you will find a good collection of national costumes, tapestry and embroidery exhibited in a restored house.</li>

                                <p>Areas that we recommend you visit are the Germasogeia dam, a calm and scenic area that is a favorite of local anglers.

                                        <p>This is where the International Airport is located and where our wedding venue will be. Larnaca is around 40 mins from Nicosia and 30 mins from Ayia Napa and Limassol. A stay here is recommended if you prefer to spend the night of the wedding somewhere close to the venue, or if your flight leaves the next day of the wedding. We would generally recommend not to spend your full holiday in Larnaca as there are much nicer cities to visit.</p> </div>

                                <p>Paphos (Pafos) and sometimes even mistakenly said as Pathos, is the mythical birthplace of Aphrodite today consists of four Municipalities, being Paphos, Yeroskipou, Peyia, and Polis Chrysochous (often abreviated to Polis). It is also generally categorised as two regions, with the coastal region being known as Kato (low) Paphos, and the higher region being known as Pano (high) Paphos. One of the best attractions in Paphos is its fishing harbour, which is an ideal place for relaxation, and a great place to eat a platter of freshly caught and cooked fish. Also at the harbour is the Pafos Castle, which was originally built in the 13th century as a Byzantine fort. There are a wide array of excellent hotels in Paphos, and a vast choice of restaurants and tavernas serving local and International cuisine. You are sure to have fantastic holidays in Cyprus year after year, whether it be during high season for the hot summer sun, or for a late winter break to escape the cold British winter weather.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>The Rock of Aphrodite</b> is one of the first places most tourists head for which is, at Petra Tou Romiou (Rock of the Greek). Legend has it that this was the birthplace of Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty, whom arose from the sea. It is said that if you swim around the Aphrodite Rock then you will be blessed with eternal beauty, however, as the seas here are quite rough, we wouldn't reccommend it.
The Baths of Aphrodite are another popular place for beautiful scenic views. The baths are found near Polis, and said to be a source of fertility. The legend goes that after swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bay, Aphrodite used to bathe in a cool pond nearby (the baths) surrounded by idyllic landscape, and sweet smelling wild flowers. It is here that she met her beloved Adonis for the first time.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Temple of Aphrodite</b> - Near Kouklia Village one can visit the ruins of the legedary Temple of Aphrodite that once stood on a knoll about 2km inland of the old Kouklia, overlooking the sea. These ancient remains date back to the 12th century B.C . There is also a museum gothic Lusignan Court , where you can see the famous mosaic with Leda, and Zeus in the form of a swan.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Adonis baths and waterfalls</b> said to be the place where Adonis and used to meet and bathe with Aphrodite, spending much of their time together here as it was their favourite place. It was also here that many of their children were supposedly born. However, it was also the place where Adonis died in the arms of his lover Aphrodite after a man disguised as a wild boar fatally wounded him in battle. Outside of the baths, there is a sign beside the statues of the lovers, which says ' Ladies infertile who wish to become pregnant touch Adonis's appendage and have many children thereafter'. The baths lie below a waterfall with high cliffs either side. Swimming in the Adonis baths is said to make women look younger and more beautiful, and men stronger.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Tombs of the Kings</b>, lies 2km north-west of Paphos harbour, and is a large necropolis (a burial ground with structrual tombs). Dating back to the 4th century BC, the underground tombs which are carved out of the solid rock, are not actually burial sites of any Kings, but are thought to be the burial sites of Paphitic aristocrats and high officials, and was named The Tombs of the Kings because of the grandeur of the tombs.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Mosaics of Paphos</b>, There are five houses close to each other near Paphos harbour which have been named as The House of The House of Dionysos, The House of Theseus, The House of Aion, The House of Orpheus, and The House of Four Seasons. Each of them have some remarkably preserved mosaic flooring dating back to the 2nd 3rd and 4th Centuries A.D. The mosaics depict scenes from Greek mythology, yet it is not known who the elite houses belonged to.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Paphos District Archeological Museum</b> constists of five exhibition rooms which house archaeological artifacts and remains that were found during excavations in and around the Paphos area from Neolithic times to the 18th century. The collection continues to grow as more artefacts are unearthed from excavations.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Ancient Odeon</b>, a small 2nd century Odeon built entirely of limestone blocks can be found in Kato Paphos near to the remains of the ancient city walls. The odeon is still put to good use today with musical and theatrical performances during the summer.</li>
                                    <li><b>The Folk Art Museum</b> can be found at Geroskipou. Known as the House of Hadjismith because of the close relations its owner had with the British Admiral sir Sidney Smith, and the fact that a member of this family had made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land (hadji means a pilgrim). The house, now listed as an ancient monument, belonged to Andreas Zimboulakis, who was a rich and educated man, appointed as British Consular Agent for western Cyprus and responsible for the provisioning of the British troops. It has been a Folk Art Museum since 1978 and it contains a large and diverse collection of exhibits originating from all over Cyprus representing the daily life, the various crafts and activities and the different expressions of Cypriot folk art during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</li>
